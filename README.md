# TradingIndicators_onCrypto
This repository will be a set of python scripts with many different algorithmic implementation of indicators used for traiding. But why am i doing this? basically since many months i'm passioned in crypto trading, dreaming to find some useful trading strategy to test and use on my Binance acocunt (with API, whose use is implemented in these scripts), hopefully proficent...ðŸ˜‚ Of course is not that easy and actually I just tested live a grid trading strategy (not present since i do not like it that much)....and again (as for NYT repository) now is almost midnight and all the scripts are on another pc, in the nest days i will upload them and also complete this readME file,  with more explanations and/or links to useful articles/tools/whatever i used during the implementation of these codes...ENJOY âœŒ
